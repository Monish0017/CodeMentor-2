The directory `/codementor-mobile/codementor-mobile/assets/images/icons` is intended to store icon images for the application. Since you haven't specified any particular icons to include, I will create a placeholder file structure for icons. You can later add your actual icon images to this directory.

Here are the contents for the directory:

/codementor-mobile/codementor-mobile/assets/images/icons
- icon-home.png
- icon-profile.png
- icon-settings.png
- icon-notifications.png
- icon-leaderboard.png
- icon-coding.png
- icon-interview.png

You can create these files as placeholders or replace them with your actual icon images as needed.
